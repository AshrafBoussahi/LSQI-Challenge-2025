# Projects Overview

This folder contains all the sub-folders with the individual team projects. Make sure that you develop your code project in a folder located in this projects folder.

We are managing all projects in this way to have a good oversight of all submissions.

Make also sure that when you open up a pull request to submit your project to this repo to have the necessary license file (MIT or Apache 2.0) located in your project folder.

The project folder names will consist of the project number and the team name, e.g. "07_PKPD-QuantSimulators". If the team name is too long, then the folder will be changed to "07_Project".

Via the github issues board (https://github.com/Quantum-Innovation-Challenge/LSQI-Challenge-2025/issues) we will have a more dedicated overview of all contributions.
